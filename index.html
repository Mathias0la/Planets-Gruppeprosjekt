          Known for its vibrant azure color, Neptune is a planet of extremes,
          where winds reach speeds of up to 1,500 miles per hour, the fastest in
          the solar system. This icy giant orbits nearly 3 billion miles from
          the Sun and has a unique, dynamic atmosphere with storms larger than
          Earth itself. Despite its distance, Neptuneâ€™s captivating rings, faint
          but mesmerizing, and its largest moon, Triton, offer glimpses into the
          fascinating outer reaches of our cosmic neighborhood.
